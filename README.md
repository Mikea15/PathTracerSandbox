Path Tracer Sandbox
====================================================================================================

## Overview
This is a path tracer sandbox project made so I could learn about ray tracing and rendering. It is based on Peter Shirley's books on Ray Tracing, and SmallPT.

## Got'a fix?
If you find an issue, feel free to either contribute, or drop me an email.
